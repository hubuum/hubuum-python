## How to contribute

### Reporting bugs

If you find a bug in the Hubuum, please create issue on GitHub. If possible, you can submit a Pull Request with a fix. Please follow the [Pull Request Guidelines](#pull-request-guidelines) below.

### Suggesting Enhancements

If you find yourself wishing for a feature that doesn't exist in Hubuum, you are probably not alone. There are bound to be others out there with similar needs. Many of the features that Hubuum has today have been added because our users saw the need. Open an issue on GitHub which describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. Pull requests from the community are always welcome and can be a quick way to get your fix or improvement slated for the next release. If you are thinking of adding a new feature or change the API, it is best to open an issue first. This way, other people can chime in on the discussion before you do any work.

### Pull Request Guidelines

Before you submit a pull request, please make sure the following is done:

1. Fork the repository and create your branch from `main`.
2. Check that the tests pass and code style is valid by running `tox`.
3. Check that coverage is 100% by running `tox -e coverage` and then `coverage report -m`.
