# Hubuum, a single pane of glass

Hubuum (𒄷𒁍𒌝) in Sumerian translates as “axle” or “wheel assembly”[1]. The goal of Hubuum is to be the main hub for anyone wanting information about ones IT equipment, people, buildings, rooms, or anything else of interest. 

All in one UI, all with one API.

## Concept

There are a million systems out there. They all have their interfaces. They all have their UIs. But we don't want UIs. We want *one* UI that gathers information from all other systems and presents it in ways that are useful.

## Design

Hubuum aims to have a small core of data models that track information gathered from Hubuum modules.
