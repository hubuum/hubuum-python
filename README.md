`Hubuum` (𒄷𒁍𒌝) in Sumerian translates as “axle” or “wheel assembly”,
although it is a
[loanword](https://sumerianlanguage.tumblr.com/post/681905416832172032/how-do-you-say-wheel-in-sumerian)
from Akkadian. The goal of Hubuum is to be the main hub for anyone wanting
information about ones IT equipment, people, buildings, rooms, or anything
else of interest.

All in one UI, all with one API.

## Concept

There are a million systems out there. They all have their interfaces. They all
have their UIs. But we don't want UIs. We want *one* UI that gathers information
from all other systems and presents it in ways that are useful.

## Design

Hubuum aims to have a small core of data models that track information gathered
from Hubuum modules. For more information about the design, please see the
documentation in the `docs` folder.
